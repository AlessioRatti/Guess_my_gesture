To visualize a stickman animated according to data acquired with a Kinect V2, open the skeleton_visualization script and
replace the string in cd with the string identifying the path to the folder 'Dataset_Lab'.
Then run the script section by section.
Notice that the list menu shows all the names used to save the files and that the filepath_builder does not perform any
control on the existence of the selected 'subject/gesture_repetition' combination.
