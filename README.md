# Gesture recognition in embodied mirroring setup

We developed an efficient algorithm for gesture recognition to be exploited within an embodied mirroring setup for autistic children. The use of robot-mediated therapy has been suggested as a potentially powerful tool to improve social, cognitive, and motor skills in autistic children. Embodied mirroring setups (including a robot, a motion tracking, and a feedback system where the robot is able to mirror the movement of a tracked person and give a feedback on the execution of the movement) are being developed to this aim. The implementation of a feedback system is fundamental to achieve the best training: only correctly executed gestures should be mirrored by the robot during the execution of an exercise, in order to train functional motor skills. To reach this goal, in this project an algorithm for the recognition of gestures, captured by a Kinect, was developed, it was trained on a dataset acquired by ourselves and it will be used in an embodied mirroring setup.

Python and MATLAB (R) were used to analyze the gathered data and implement the algorithm.
